NAME
    Games::Go::Coordinate - Represents a board coordinate in the game of Go

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::Go::Coordinate;

        my $c1 = Games::Go::Coordinate->new(x => 4, y => 3);
        my $c2 = Games::Go::Coordinate->new(x => 4, y => 10);
        if ($c2 gt $c1) {
            # ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class represents a board coordinate in the game of Go. Coordinate
    objects can be compared (as strings) to see whether two ranks are equal
    or whether one rank is higher than the other. Coordinate objects
    stringify to the SGF notation (for example, "(4,10)" stringifies to
    "dj".

METHODS
  set_sgf_coordinate
        $coord->set_sgf_coordinate('cf');

    Takes a coordinate in SGF notation and sets "x()" and "y()" from it.

  new_from_sgf_coordinate
        my $cord = Games::Go::Coordinate->new_from_sgf_coordinate('cf');

    Alternative constructor that accepts an SGF coordinate and sets "x()"
    and "y()" from it.

  to_sgf
    Returns the coordinate in SGF notation. This is also how the coordinate
    object stringifies.

  as_list
    Returns the coordinate in "(x,y)" notation. For example, it might return
    a string "(16,17)".

  translate
        $coord->translate(2, -3);

    Takes as arguments - in that order - a horizontal delta and a vertical
    delta and translates the coordinate by those deltas.

  str_cmp
    FIXME
